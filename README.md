# MD_utillities

- Code for pre- and post-processing in Molecular Dynamics, mainly for [NAMD](/namd/) - including [umbrella sampling](/umbrella_sampling) and [smd](/SMD/); [GROMACS](/gromacs/) & [VMD](/vmd_scripts/).
- There are some more complex [Gnuplot](/Gnuplot/) scripts available; for basics refer to Gnuplot manual or [one-liners](ONE_LINERS.md).
- [Miscaleneous](/misc) is a collection of scripts that don't fit anywhere else.

## Useful Bash commands
Collection of one-line bash commands that might come in handy is available [here](ONE_LINERS.md).

### Umbrella_sampling
Files were orginally obtained from NAMD umbrella sampling tutorial
