Gnuplot

-Plot with pipe:
  awk '/remaining/{print $2,  $9}' D2.out | gnuplot -p -e "plot '-'" 
  (plots remaining time vs. Timestep of Namd output)  
  Generalised:
  awk '/pattern/{print $1,  $2}' filename | gnuplot -p -e "plot '-'" 
  - awk emulates grep here, $2, $9 – string separated by spaces ($0 is a full string)
  - gnuplot: -p : persist, -e : execute one command in "", plot '-' : plot from pipe (works on UNIX only)

Head & tail

Print 1st ten lines: 
  head –n 10 filename
Print everything except 1st 10 lines: 
  tail -n +11 filename
