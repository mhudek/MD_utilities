Gnuplot

-Plot with pipe:
  awk '/remaining/{print $2,  $9}' D2.out | gnuplot -p -e "plot '-'" 
  (plots remaining time vs. Timestep of Namd output)  
  Generalised:
  awk '/pattern/{print $1,  $2}' filename | gnuplot -p -e "plot '-'" 
  - awk emulates grep here, $2, $9 – string separated by spaces ($0 is a full string)
  - gnuplot: -p : persist, -e : execute one command in "", plot '-' : plot from pipe (works on UNIX only)

Quick statistics with Gnuplot:
  gnuplot -e "stats 'filename' u 2"
  2 refers to column 2 of the file, use this for example to calculate average number of hydrogen bonds from hbonds.dat
